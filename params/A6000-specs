108 SMs (listed as num_sim_cores and num_sim_small_cores)
4 subpartitions per SM
192KB/SM of combined shared memory and L1 data cache
256KB RF/SM but 64KB/subpartition
40MB L2 cache?

A6000 has 6MB in L2 
accel-sim config shows 64 sets, 128 line size, 16 way accossiativity
by the equation from macsim, that gives 48 tiles
